# Gutenberg #79380 — lightbox trigger button has no accessible name without JavaScript

**Status:** patch prepared, held in reserve. Issue filed, awaiting a maintainer
signal before opening a PR.

- Issue: <https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/79380>
- Patch: [`gutenberg-79380-lightbox-button-name.patch`](gutenberg-79380-lightbox-button-name.patch)
- Theme-side fallback already shipped: `functions.php` (`dirtbag_lightbox_trigger_label`, 0.1.12)

## The problem

Core renders the image lightbox trigger as a bare
`<button class="lightbox-trigger">` whose accessible name comes only from the
Interactivity API at runtime (`data-wp-bind--aria-label="state.thisImage.triggerButtonAriaLabel"`).
With JavaScript off, or before hydration, the button has no accessible name and
fails the WCAG 4.1.2 `button-name` check.

This is **not** the same as [#78426](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/78426),
which restored the label — but via that same runtime binding. The server-rendered
HTML still ships without a name.

## The fix

`block_core_image_render_lightbox()` in
`packages/block-library/src/image/index.php` builds the button as a heredoc
string. The patch adds a **static** `aria-label` to that markup, reusing the exact
label already stored in the Interactivity state (`triggerButtonAriaLabel => __( 'Enlarge' )`):

```php
$trigger_button_aria_label = esc_attr__( 'Enlarge' );
// ...
. '<button
    class="lightbox-trigger"
    type="button"
    aria-haspopup="dialog"
    aria-label="' . $trigger_button_aria_label . '"
    data-wp-bind--aria-label="state.thisImage.triggerButtonAriaLabel"
    ...'
```

JS-off and pre-hydration now have a name ("Enlarge"); hydration still applies the
bound value (also "Enlarge"), so behaviour with JS is unchanged. No new strings —
`Enlarge` is already translated for the runtime label.

## Test to include with the PR

Extend the image-block render coverage (e.g.
`phpunit/blocks/render-block-core-image.php`, or wherever the lightbox render is
tested) with an assertion that the static name is present:

```php
public function test_lightbox_trigger_has_static_aria_label() {
    $content = do_blocks(
        '<!-- wp:image {"id":1,"lightbox":{"enabled":true}} -->' .
        '<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://example.com/x.jpg" alt="x" class="wp-image-1"/></figure>' .
        '<!-- /wp:image -->'
    );

    // The trigger carries a static accessible name (not only the runtime binding).
    $this->assertMatchesRegularExpression(
        '/<button[^>]*class="lightbox-trigger"[^>]*aria-label="Enlarge"/s',
        $content
    );
    // The runtime binding is still present so JS can refine the label.
    $this->assertStringContainsString( 'data-wp-bind--aria-label="state.thisImage.triggerButtonAriaLabel"', $content );
}
```

## Turning this into a PR (when ready)

1. `git clone https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg && cd gutenberg && npm ci`
2. `git apply ../dirtbag/docs/repro/gutenberg-79380-lightbox-button-name.patch`
   (the patch is rooted at the repo top, `a/packages/...`).
3. Add the test above; run `npm run test:unit:php -- --filter lightbox` (or the
   project's current PHP test command).
4. Open the PR against `trunk`, referencing #79380, with a one-line summary:
   "Image: give the lightbox trigger a static aria-label for the no-JS /
   pre-hydration state."
5. No self-prop; credit per the project's contributor-attribution norms.

If the maintainers prefer the runtime-only approach (the #78426 stance), the
theme-side fallback stays as the local fix and this patch is retired.
